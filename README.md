CRAQ is a distributed [object-storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) system that maintains strong consistency while still providing a high read throughput. 
Object-storage systems are better suited for applications that need flat namespaces, such as a key-value store. 
These are unlike file-based systems, which store data in a hierarchical directory structure.
